# LJ Code 301 - Day 10
Date: *21 Apr 2017*

Not much to say really. A bit disappointed we didn't have lecture Friday, but the material from Thursday made sense. At my last job, we used to have a guy that would help me out by running mountains of SQL queries for everything. I remember looking at them and understanding that the code looked pretty simple, bit still being stumped by it all. Even when I tried to read some tutorials, I wasn't able to understand it. Having a more visual representation of this database data though really helped my contextualize things, and it's nice to be able to understand SQL now. I know I still have to learn a lot and build proficiency, but it seems straightforward enough.
