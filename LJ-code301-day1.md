# LJ Code 301 - Day 1
**Date: *10 Apr 2017* **

It was fun covering the basics of mobile first design. The lab helped me understand some of the concepts a better, and helped me cement some of the concepts we've touched on in the past (vw, vh, line-height, etc). My main concern right now is the sort of undefined nature of the portfolio project. I understand the intent is to leave it a little bit undefined, in order to allow everyone to approach it at their own pace and according to their own ability. On the flip side, though, part of the great appeal of something like Code Fellows to me is the more structured learning environment. I tend to obsess over little details, and without any defined expectations, I can easily see myself spending far more time than intended grinding away at the portfolio page.
