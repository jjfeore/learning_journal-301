# LJ Code 301 - Day 11
Date: *24 Apr 2017*

Filter, map, and reduce are all cool addition. They take a little bit of thought, but as I get more and more used to them, I'm sure it will begin to come more naturally.

I don't really care for arrow functions though. The time they save seems like a poor trade versus the extra potential for errors, the various stipulations (e.g. no object literals), and just building coding habits that don't translate into other languages. I feel like Javascript already carries around enough baggage from being almost too forgiving, and adding something new to that mix just feels like teaching myself a new bad habit. I'll probably use these for the course, but stay away otherwise.
