# LJ Code 301 - Day 5
Date: *16 Apr 2017*

This week has been really great. During the first week of 201, I was a little disappointed by the pace of the course and how little we learned with respect to the prework, but this first week was a lot more helpful. Learning handlebars was great, and getting to play around with jQuery was definitely a huge time saver. I'm pumped to see what we're going to do with Node and all the back-end stuff. It's just cool to think how close I am to being able to build a true CMS.
