# LJ Code 301 - Day 8
Date: *19 Apr 2017*

We've finally hit the point I've been looking forward to for a month-and-a-half: I'm completely out of my depth. I am completely unfamiliar with all this backend stuff, and it's great. Getting to mess with AJAX, Node, and SQL is pretty cool. There are some things I still don't fully understand, but I do understand everything at least well enough to make it work... kinda. Each day I get a little bit closer to being able to visualize how to do the 301 project I have in mind, and that's awesome.
