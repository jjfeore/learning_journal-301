# LJ Code 301 - Day 15
Date: *30 Apr 2017*

Another late learning journal. This thing with having the learning journal due on Saturday at noon and everything else on Sunday at midnight keeps throwing me off. Maybe that can be changed for the future?

At this point, it's starting to sound (probably well past "starting to") whiny, but I really dislike the way the portfolios have been going. I just finished submitting my portfolio assignments, and it was basically just an exercise in copy and paste. There isn't even any reinforcement of the ideas because we don't have to do anything to extend them. Worse still, the portfolio assignment actively penalizes you for trying to go beyond the bounds of the assignment at any point. If you build outside the scope of the assignment, you can very easily box yourself into a design corner that's more difficult to code yourself out of. Basically, the more like Kilovolt blog you make your portfolio, the easier it is to build. It isn't even really a portfolio any more, so much as it is a blog. It just disheartens me that I've lost all the flavor and simplicity out of what I thought was going to be a real portfolio page, and I instead ended up with a low-effort version of kilovolt.

On another note, I'm real excited for project week. I think our team is going to get along great, and I think the resulting app is going to be an exciting one. I'm pumped to think that we'll be able to have a functioning website with an actual userbase at the end of this. Is deploying to AWS difficult? Could we reasonably do so for this assignment?
