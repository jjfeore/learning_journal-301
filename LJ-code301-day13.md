# LJ Code 301 - Day 13
Date: *26 Apr 2017*

I've been enjoying the data structures stuff a lot. Like I was saying at the end of class, I'd love to see something like that become more of a formal part of 301, in lieu of the portfolio. As we've gotten further and further into the portfolio project, it has felt increasingly contrived and gotten further and further away from the initial idea of just making our own portfolio. If we're going to be doing contrived stuff, I feel like it ought to be either in the form of more robust labs or just more data structures.

Barring all that, I think some more guidance on what we should expect the portfolio to look like at the end would be nice. I feel like I started down a path with my portfolio that doesn't jive with where the portfolio assignments are going, and that's contributing to the feeling of it being sort of tacked on.
