# LJ Code 301 - Day 6
Date: *17 Apr 2017*

This AJAX stuff is really exciting. I remember during the 201, some folks started to joke that they could see the Matrix. This is approaching that moment for me. As we get closer and closer to working with the backend, I'm getting a better and better idea of how the web works. Throughout these courses, I've had a couple ideas for projects kicking around my head, and as we learn more, it's gratifying to draw increasingly close being able to build those projects.
