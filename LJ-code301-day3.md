# LJ Code 301 - Day 3
Date: *12 Apr 2017*

I've really been enjoying working with jQuery, and I'm super excited to mess around with handlebars. The data structures whiteboarding stuff is a great idea, and I enjoyed working on it yesterday. I really think the rest of the class needs some context for these data structures though. Everyone I tried to explain them to the other day kept trying to reframe linked lists in terms of arrays or other similarly poor comparisons. If they could see even a few basic examples of why and how linked lists can be used, I think that would help folks visualize them a bit better.
